# We've been talking a lot of the satisfying problem, but using
# tools like Z3, we can also solve optimization problem.
# the 0-1 knapsack problem is often solved by the dynamic
# programming algorithm. But it's more natural and easier
# to solve with the LA theory.
# TODO: Exercise 6. 0-1 Knapsack problem.
# There are n items, with specific weight
# W = {w1, ..., wn}
# and value:
# V = {v1, ..., vn}
# For a given knapsack of capacity C, to choose some items
# such that:
#  wi+...+wk <= C
# and max(vi+...+vk).
#
# Now consider below condition:
# W = {4, 6, 2, 2, 5, 1}
# V = {8, 10, 6, 3, 7, 2}ï¼Œ
# C = 12
# Solve it with Z3.
